This repository contains my submission for Assignment 4 in the Columbia Data Analytics Bootcamp. The assignment required us to conduct an analysis on two datasets using Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks.

I imported school and student data from two separate CSV files into Jupyter and merged them. Pandas was then employed to create DataFrames for the analysis. The student data provides information about students, their respective high schools, and their performance in reading and math tests. The school data includes a list of schools in a district, their types, budgets, and student populations.

Utilizing this data, I summarized key metrics such as the average math and reading scores for students at each school, the percentage of students passing math and reading at each school, the overall passing rate for students at each school, and the performance of students across different grade levels. Furthermore, I examined school performance based on size, budget, and type.

Upon completing the analysis, I synthesized my observations gleaned from the data, providing insights into the relationships and trends discovered.
